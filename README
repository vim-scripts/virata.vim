Virata AConfig Configuration Script Syntax
is used in AConfig scripts to build ISOS firmware.
This syntax can be detected by a combination of the following:
 1) The file extension ".hw", ".sw", ".pkg" and ".module",
 2) The file name pattern "mk.*\.cfg",
 3) The string "Virata" or "Conexant" in the first 5 lines,
 4) The subdirectory "/atmos/" in the scripts' full path.
Note that due to mergers Virata has become part of Conexant.
